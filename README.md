💳 Net Banking System
This project is a basic online banking web application developed as a group project using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC. It simulates common features of real-world net banking systems and helped us as a team to understand how web applications interact with databases.

We worked together to handle frontend (using JSP), backend logic (Servlets), and database operations (JDBC + MySQL). The system is simple but covers key functionalities found in any online banking portal.

👨‍💻 Team Members
We collaborated to divide tasks like:

Designing JSP pages

Writing Servlet logic

Handling database operations

Testing and debugging

This teamwork helped us understand modular development in Java web apps.

✅ Features
The system supports:

User Login (account number + password)

Balance Check

Money Transfer (between users)

Transaction History

Account Details View

All data is stored and retrieved using MySQL with JDBC.

🛠 Technologies Used
Java (Servlets)

JSP (Frontend)

JDBC (Database Connectivity)

MySQL (Database)

HTML & CSS (for basic styling)

We didn’t use any advanced frameworks intentionally, to focus on core Java EE concepts.

🧾 Sample Users
We tested the application with two dummy users:

331966426 – Virat Kohli – kohli@5101

331964880 – Rohit Sharma – sharma@5101.


🎯 What We Learned
Servlet lifecycle and form handling

JSP page design and dynamic content

How JDBC connects Java code with databases

Session handling and request-response cycle

Working as a team and dividing logic layer-wise

🚀 How to Run Locally
Import project in IntelliJ / Eclipse

Set up Apache Tomcat server

Configure MySQL and update connection URL

Deploy and run on localhost:8080

Use sample users to log in

❗ Notes
This is a basic level academic project

Security and validation are kept simple

Meant for learning and demonstration purposes
